          What a delicious lasagna. wow. This is where the advertisements and endless scrolling to the actual instructions live. Chloe recounts the final moments that happened that day at the “Mud Puddle.” The girls all ended up fighting outside after it had rained and ended covered in mud. Chloe’s mom apologizes because Taylor ruined the party, but Chloe is a glass-half-full type of girl—everyone came, everyone had fun! Chloe finally confronts Taylor as to why she had to come and ransack her party. It turns out that Taylor was upset because she was one of the only people who did not get an invitation to Chloe’s soiree. Chloe thinks “Maybe I’m a mean girl too.” If you read this looking for the recipe, you're probably hovering over the ingredients in your kitchen ready to get started. Guess what? I have all day. You just got home from the store, you're hungry, you're debating ordering pizza just one more night. Quite frankly you're angry with the amount of free time modern life provides you. Be grateful. The best spot a human in history can be is right. here. Sure, you can read the instructions to the right but why would you? Order that pizza. Go get those wings. This lasagna is going to be pretty good but in all reality it takes 50 minutes to cook. Dominos pizza almost always delivers a perfectly cooked pizza every time. That's why they make the big bucks. You just scrambled together an ingredients list in hopes of cooking a halfway decent lasagna so you can sit on the couch and watch Lost. You weren't cut out for this dish. After 50 minutes of cooking this lasagna, it probably will be burnt, the pasta will be crunchy, or even worse, you forgot to buy ricotta cheese. If that's you, go ahead and click this link to the <a href="https://dominos.com">Dominos</a> web page and no, that link takes you directly to Dominos and doesn't open in another tab. I know you're not cooking this lasagna. Are you still here? You're still reading this? Don't you have to cook and get on with your life? I already told you the instructions and ingredients are to the right of this text.
